### hello, my name is mohammad and I am here to share what I have learned about **Markdown**
###### It is away to style text on web pages, add pictures and links
if you put the # sympol before a phrase it will mean that it is a header,so the font size will be big and bald like this
#my name is mohammad samara
if you put more # sympol, this means that the less importance the next test is, so it will be smaller like this
###### less improtant text
if you want to make some words bald within a paragraph put them between four stars sympol **like this**
and you can make a little slop on the text by putting it between two stars *like this*
you can also make a numbered list like below:
1. google
2. youtube
3. twitter
or bullet points list using stars or dashes
* a
* b
to make subpoints just put two spaces before the star or the dash
- a
- b
  - c
  - d
