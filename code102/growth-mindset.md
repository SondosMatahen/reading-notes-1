# growth mindset
### my name is mohammad samara and I am here to explain what is **growth mindset**
first what do we mean by mindset?
it is the way you think about your self or self-thory and there is two type of mindset:
1. fixed mindset
2. growth mindset

### the table below will show us the difference between the two mindset when facing a various of situations:

The situation | fixed mindset | growth mindset
--------------|---------------|---------------
challenges | avoid | embrace
obstacles | loses focus | persists
effort | views as fruitless | no pain no gain
criticism | ignore it | learns from it
success of others | views as a threat | inspired by |

so you can figure out that fixed mindset believes that intellegence and abilities can't be improved, and there is no need for effort, so they won't improve or reach full capabilities

while growth mindset sees that intellegence and abilities can be improved through effort and hard work, so at the end they achieve higher goals and success more.
